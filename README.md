This is a translator of [Python](https://www.python.org/) to [EOLANG](https://www.eolang.org).
#### What is the traspiler? ####
> A source-to-source translator, source-to-source compiler (S2S compiler), transcompiler, or transpiler is a type of translator that takes the source code of a program written in a programming language as its input and produces an equivalent source code in the same or a different programming language

#### What is it? ####
This is a translator of [Python](https://www.python.org/) to [EOLANG](https://www.eolang.org). It is needed for transpiling `Python` code to `EOLANG` programming language. After successful transpiling final `EOLANG` code will be available for analyzing via [Polystat analyzer](https://github.com/polystat/polystat) which will notify you about leak places in the code. 

#### How does it work? ####
This transpiler receives as input data python code. Then received code is simplified with AST usage. After successfull simplyfying it is sent to the `py2eo` translator for getting `EOLANG`.

#### What do you need to use it? ####
* `Ubuntu` (20.04+) or `Windows` (7+)
* [Java 14+](https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk14.0.2/205943a0976c4ed48cb16f1043c5c647/12/GPL/openjdk-14.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz) - check in command line `java --version`. Use `sudo apt install openjdk-16-jdk-headless` in `Ubuntu 20` (there is no `java 14` package there).
* For contributors: `Maven 3.6.3` with `Java 14` or `Maven 3.8.4` with `Java 17` (but there is no `Maven 3.8` package in `Ubuntu` and no `Java 14` package, so manual installation is needed anyway)

#### How to use it? ####
- Go to some directory on your PC
- Create directory `Transpiler Test`
- Download and save into this folder `py2eo` transpiler executable from this [link](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/polystat/py2eo/0.0.4/py2eo-0.0.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar)
- Create in this folder test file with `python` code named `sample_test.py` and paste the code below into it:
    ```
    def conditionalCheck2():
        a = 4
        b = 2
    ```
- Open command line and move to the folder `Transpiler Test`
- Run command `java -jar .\py2eo-${version_code}-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar .\sample_test.py`
- Check output .eo file in `Transpiler Test/genCageEO/sample_test.eo` or in `path_to_output_folder/sample_test.eo` in case of usage `-o` command line parameter


#### Command line arguments ####
| Option  | Action |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `-h,--help`  | Display help information  |
| `-o`  | path to output .eo file  |
| `-X,--debug`  | Produce execution debug output  |
| `-v,--version`  | Display version information  |

#### How to contribute? ####
- This instruction is for `Ubuntu 20.04`
- Check git version `git -version` or install it via `sudo apt install git`
- Install maven (`sudo apt install maven`)
- You need exactly `Java version 14`, so download it [here](https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk14.0.2/205943a0976c4ed48cb16f1043c5c647/12/GPL/openjdk-14.0.2_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz), unpack it and manually setup the `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` variables. For example, you may open command line and run these commands:
```
cd ~
wget https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk14.0.1/664493ef4a6946b186ff29eb326336a2/7/GPL/openjdk-14.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
tar x -z < openjdk-14.0.1_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
PATH="$PWD/jdk-14.0.1/bin/:$PATH"
export JAVA_HOME="$PWD/jdk-14.0.1/"
```
- Check `java` version `java -version`
- Download project of [Python to EOLANG transpiler](https://github.com/polystat/py2eo) with source code (via `git clone` or downloading of `zip`)
- Run command `mvn clean package -DskipTests=true` in the same command line runtime were you have set `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` variables
- Open `./target` folder (via `cd target` for example)
- Create test file named `sample_test.py` in this folder and paste the code below into it:
    ```
    def conditionalCheck2():
        a = 4
        b = 2
    ```
- Run command `java -jar .\py2eo-${version_code}-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar .\sample_test.py`
- Check output `.eo` file in `./genCageEO/sample_test.eo` 

#### Checker ####
This repository's CI includes checker - a tool that reduces project testing time using input test mutations. Checkout more [here](https://github.com/polystat/py2eo/blob/master/checker/).

## Tests coverage
At the moment, we have 3 different gorups of tests for Py2EO transpiler (checker with mutations are out of scope here):

- [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.8/Lib/test), Python language implementation tests, version `3.8`)
For all tests (250,000+ lines of Python code), `EO` is generated and passes `EO` syntax check stage. Subsequent `Java` generation (and, therefore, `Java` compilation and execution), comes to `Python` runtime transpilation issue (link?). Got plans to achive it soon, after we pass majority of functional "simple" tests first.

- [Django](https://github.com/django/django), a popular `Python` web framework
For all `.py` files (every `.py` is considered as particular test) from Django repository (440,000+ lines of Python code) `EO` is generated and passes `EO` syntax check stage. Yet not tried to generate Java for this group, since it estimates about a week of total runtime. Compiling and execution of Java code obtained this way seems to be pointless.

- [Handwritten tests](https://github.com/polystat/py2eo/tree/master/transpiler/src/test/resources/org/polystat/py2eo/transpiler), set of tests divided into groups by type: functional (also divided into groups by constructs in accordance with the language specification), integration tests (tests for the polystat analyzer), "breaking" tests, etc.
Functional tests (https://github.com/polystat/py2eo/tree/master/transpiler/src/test/resources/org/polystat/py2eo/transpiler/simple-tests, 1600+ lines of code). A detailed description of the particular tests is given [on a separate wiki page](https://github.com/polystat/py2eo/wiki/Tests-Structure). All these tests go through a full cycle of stages: from generating EO to executing Java. Progress is provided in release description. Check the [latest](https://github.com/polystat/py2eo/releases) for actual state.

## Examples of translation projections

### 6.1 Arithmetic conversion
Complex and float numbers are not yet supported, so no implicit conversion is needed.

### 6.2.4 6.2.5 6.2.6 6.2.7 Displays for lists, sets and dictionaries
Will be supported via a python-to-python pass: a display will be converted to a `for` loop

### 6.2.8 Generator expressions
Same as displays

### 6.2.9 Yield expression
Is a part of coroutines. No plans to support the coroutines now.

### 6.3.4 Call


### 7.1 Expressions statements
Should be easy but not yet done.

### 7.2 Assignment statements
Note:
* `x` is prepended to each variable name in order to support capital first letter of a name
* local variable names are statically extracted and declared as `cage` in the beginning of a generated output
##### Python
`x = 1`
##### EO
This is added at the start of the generated function
```
cage > xx
```
This is put at the appropriate place according to the execution order
```
(xx).write (1)
```

##### Python
`x = x + 1`
##### EO
Seems overly complicated, but this is a generalized variant of [this](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/issues/462#issuecomment-989631295) hack.
Maybe the part with `dddata` can be simplified.
```
seq > @
  [] > tmp1
    memory > dddata
    dddata.write (((xx).add 1)) > @
  (e0).write (tmp1.dddata)
  ((e0).<)
  mkCopy (e0) > tmp2
  (xx).write (tmp2.copy)
  123
```
where `mkCopy` looks like this
```
[x] > mkCopy
  x' > copy
  copy.< > @
```

### 7.3 Assert
Will be done as a python-to-python pass, which basically substitutes `assert` to `raise AssertionException`

### 7.4 Pass
Does nothing

### 7.5 Del
Is an operator to delete attributes of objects dynamically. Not supported therefore.

### 7.6 Return
See [the section on function definition](https://github.com/polystat/py2eo#86-function-definition)

### 7.7 Yield
Is a part of coroutines. No plans to support the coroutines now.

### 7.8 Raise
See [the section on exceptions](https://github.com/polystat/py2eo#84-try)

### 7.9 Break
See [the section on while](https://github.com/polystat/py2eo#82-while)

### 7.10 Continue
See [the section on while](https://github.com/polystat/py2eo#82-while)

### 7.11 Import
Not yet supported. 

### 7.12 Global
Later. Needs closure for full support. 

### 7.13 Nonlocal 
Later. Needs closure for full support. 

### 8.1 If-elif-else

##### Python
```
x = 1
if True:
  x = 2
```

##### EO
```
cage > tmp
cage > xx
seq > @
  (xx).write (1)
  TRUE.if
    seq
      (xx).write (2)
      TRUE
    seq
      TRUE
  123
```

##### Python
```
x = 1
if True:
  x = 2
elif False:
  x = 3
else:
  x = 4
```

##### EO
```
cage > tmp
cage > xx
seq > @
  (xx).write (1)
  TRUE.if
    seq
      (xx).write (2)
      TRUE
    seq
      FALSE.if
        seq
          (xx).write (3)
          TRUE
        seq
          (xx).write (4)
          TRUE
      TRUE
  123
```
##### Tests
https://github.com/polystat/py2eo/wiki/Tests-Structure#the-if-statement

### 8.2 While
##### Python
Imagine that the following code is a whole body of a function
```
x = 0
while True:
  x = x + 1
```

##### EO
Here, we have to support `break` with the help of `goto`, but also we should be able to pass other non-trivial returns like exceptions and `return` through the `goto` construct. This makes the code more complicated than just a direct use of `while`
First, we declare `x` and some temporary variables
```
[stackUp]
  seq > @
    cage > tmp
    cage > xx
    cage > e0
```
```
    seq > @
      (xx).write (0)
```
Here, we wrap the `while` in a `goto` and store the result
```
      write.
        xcurrent-exception
        goto
          [stackUp]
            seq > @
              TRUE.while
                [unused]
                  seq > @
 ```
 This part is just an overly generalized implementation of `x = x + 1`
 ```
                    [] > tmp1
                      memory > dddata
                      dddata.write (((xx).add 1)) > @
                    (e0).write (tmp1.dddata)
                    ((e0).<)
                    mkCopy (e0) > tmp2
                    (xx).write (tmp2.copy)
                    TRUE
 ```
 Now, if we leave the `while` normally, we must still return something to be written to the `current-exception` variable, which is the `raiseNothing` object
 ```
              stackUp.forward raiseNothing
 ```
 Next, if the `goto` result is not `break`, we basically rethrow it to the outer frame. Note, there are two `stackUp` objects here. The inner one is used to exit the while loop, while the outer one is used to exit the whole code block. It is only needed if the block is a body of another `while` or function or `try` block. 
 ```
       if.
        xcurrent-exception.xclass.xid.neq (break.xclass.xid)
        stackUp.forward xcurrent-exception
        0
```

### 8.3 For
A `for` loop over an iterator is transformed into a `while` inside a `try`:
##### Python
```
x = 0
for i in r: x = x + i
```
##### Python after `for` elimination
```
x = 0
it0 = r.__iter__()
try:
    while (True):
        i = it0.__next__()
        x = (x + i)
except StopIteration:
    pass
```
The resulting code is then transformed to EO.

### 8.4 Try
#### try_2
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5425660/166906535-171657ff-b0fd-4843-b668-39d7cf56ff79.png)
##### Python
```
  def f(a, b):
    try:
      return a
    finally:
      return b
```
##### EO
```
[] > f
  [xaNotCopied xbNotCopied] > apply
    [stackUp] > @
      cage > tmp
      xaNotCopied' > xa
      xbNotCopied' > xb
      seq > @
        stdout "xf\n"
        xa.<
        xb.<
        write.
          xcurrent-exception
          goto
            [stackUp]
              seq > @
                stackUp.forward (return (xa))
                stackUp.forward raiseNothing
        seq
          if.
            xcurrent-exception.xclass.xid.eq (raiseNothing.xclass.xid)
            seq
            0
          stackUp.forward (return (xb))
          (xcurrent-exception.xclass.xid.neq (raiseNothing.xclass.xid)).if (stackUp.forward xcurrent-exception) 0
        123
```
##### Tests
https://github.com/polystat/py2eo/wiki/Tests-Structure#the-try-statement

### 8.5 With
Not yet implemented. The plan is to do it as a python-to-python pass according do the example [here](https://docs.python.org/3.8/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement)

### 8.6 Function definition
The non-trivial part here is to allow a function body to both do a `return` and to throw exceptions, which are not caught inside the function. This necessity forces us to wrap a function body in an object to be called with the help of `goto`. 

#### Function definition example
##### Python
```
def f(): return 5
```
##### EO
Here, `apply` subobject is used to pass parameters (none in this example), the inner anonymous object with parameter `stackUp` should be called with the `goto`. 

The `stackUp` is used both 
* to throw exceptions 
* to return values normally, in which case they are wrapped into a `return` object, so that they can be differentiated from exceptions
```
[] > f
  [] > apply
    [stackUp] > @
      cage > tmp
      seq > @
        stackUp.forward (return 5)
        123
```

#### Function call example
##### Python
`x = f()`
##### EO
Here, we first actually call `f`, then we must check if it returned normally or with exception. The exception is rethrown.
The call
```
tmp.write (goto ((((xf)).apply).@))
```
Check for exception
```
(tmp.xclass.xid.neq (return.xclass.xid)).if (stackUp.forward tmp) 0
```
Extract a result from the return object
```
(e0).write (tmp.result)
((e0).<)
```
Assign its copy to `x`. 
```
mkCopy (e0) > tmp1
(xx).write (tmp1.copy)
123

```


### 8.7 Class
A class is basically its constructor, i.e., a function, which returns an object. 
##### Python
```
class c:
  field = 1
o = c()
o.field = 2
```
##### EO
Here `c` has the same calling convention as other functions (it has a field `apply` and must be called with `goto`). The inner `result` is the object to be returned. It is returned through a cage, otherwise this code just hangs.
```
[] > c
  newUID.apply 0 > xid
  [] > apply
    [stackUp] > @
      cage > pResult
      [] > result
        cage > xfield
        xc > xclass
        seq > initFields
          xfield.write 1
      seq (result.initFields) (pResult.write result) (stackUp.forward (return pResult)) > @
```
This is how object `o` is created:
```
tmp.write (goto ((((xc)).apply).@))
(tmp.xclass.xid.neq (return.xclass.xid)).if (stackUp.forward tmp) 0
(e0).write (tmp.result)
((e0).<)
mkCopy (e0) > tmp1
(xo).write (tmp1.copy)
```
Field assignment is then straightforward:
```
((xo).xfield).write (2)
```

### 8.8 Coroutines
No plans to support this.
